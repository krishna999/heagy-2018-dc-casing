    "- [DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb](notebooks/DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb): examines the feasibility of using DC resistivity for detecting a flaw in a steel-cased well and investigates the impact of parameters such as the background conductivity on our ability to detect a flaw from data collected at the surface. This notebook was used to produce Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10\n",
