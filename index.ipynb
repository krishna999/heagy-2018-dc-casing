    "- [1_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb](notebooks/1_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb) \n",
    "    - examines the feasibility of using DC resistivity for detecting a flaw in a steel-cased well and investigates the impact of parameters such as the background conductivity on our ability to detect a flaw from data collected at the surface. \n",
    "    - This notebook was used to produce Figures 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11\n",
    "\n",
    "- [2_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells_Short_well.ipynb](notebooks/2_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells_Short_well.ipynb)\n",
    "    - looks at hte impact of the vertical extent of the flaw on the distribution of charges.\n",
    "    - Used to produce Figure 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "- [3_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells_layer](notebooks/3_DC_Flawed_Steel_Cased_Wells_layer) \n",
    "    - looks at the impact of a conductive or resistive layer on our ability to detect a flaw. \n",
    "    - Used to create Figures 7, 8\n",
    "\n",
    "- [4_DC_source_location.ipynb](notebooks/4_DC_source_location.ipynb)\n",
    "    - looks at the impact of the source electrode location on our ability to deliver current to depth. \n",
    "    - This was used to produce Figures 12, 13\n",
    "\n",
    "- [5_DC_target.ipynb](notebooks/5_DC_target.ipynb)\n",
    "    - Examines our ability to excite a conductive or resistive target at depth, looks at the impact of having an electrical connection (or not) between the target and the casing\n",
    "    - This notebook was used to produce Tables 1, 2 and Figures 14, 15, 16, 17, 18\n",
    "\n",
    "- [6_DC_target_3D_cartesian.ipynb](notebooks/6_DC_target_3D_cartesian.ipynb)\n",
    "    - here, we use a born approximation approach to examine our ability to excite a target offset from the well. \n",
    "    - This notebook was used to produce Figures 19, 20, 21 \n",
    "\n",
    "- [7_DC_Approximating_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb](notebooks/7_DC_Approximating_Steel_Cased_Wells.ipynb)\n",
    "    - This notebook looks at approximations of a steel cased well by a solid cylinder, either with a conductivity equal to steel, or a conductivity that preserves the cross-sectional conductance of the well. \n",

    "You can then clone this reposiroty. From a command line, run\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/simpeg-research/heagy-2018-dc-casing.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then `cd` into the `heagy-2018-dc-casing`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd heagy-2018-dc-casing\n",
    "```\n",
